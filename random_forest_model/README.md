# About this document
This document will help the repository user to identify which notebook to use.

# Structure
There are two notebooks on this folder

- One for just the four prognosis we are interested in (Heart disease, GERD, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis)
- One for all the prognosis in the dataset

# Warning

- Both random forest model yielded almost 100% accuracy, which is unlikely in real world
- The key suspicion is that the dataset just has set of isloating combinations of symptoms which makes it easy for the model to make predictions
- Feature isolation is discussed in the notebook that has just the four prognosis to showcase how it can be isolated
- Please refer to the Data Exploration directory to see some differentiating symptoms for each prognosis
